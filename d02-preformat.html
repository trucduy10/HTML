<h3> Like stranger do</h3>
<blockquote>If you saw me on the train would you look the other way?
Like strangers do
And if you passed me on the street
Would you look down at your feet
And move on through?
Like strangers do
</blockquote>
<p>

    I miss the way that you looked in your sundress
    The way that you looked when you undressed
    The sound of your first steps across the room
    Now my friends don't ask about you
    'Cause they think I'm fine without you
    I say it's all good but it's never true (oh, no, no, woah)
